# Simulations

- Learning to make simulations in Python.
- Libraries used: pygame, random, pygame_gui, math.
- Contains a basic simulation to visualize the spread of an infectious disease using the SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) model.
- Each person is represented by a circle. The circles can be differentiated by colors; BLUE = Susceptible, Red = Infected and Green = Recovered.
- Different properties for the spread of infections; NUM_AGENTS = how many people/agents to simulate | RADIUS: size of the circle drawn for each agent | SPEED: how fast they move | INFECTION_RADIUS: how close one must be to another to transmit infection | INFECTION_TIME: how long they stay infected before recovering
- All the properties for the spread of infections can be controlled using the slider panel on the right.
- The simulation starts with one randomly infected agent and updates the infection status as agents move and collide within the infection radius.
- A screenshot of the simulation is included below.
