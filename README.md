# Simulations

- Learning to make simulations in Python.
- Libraries used: pygame, random, pygame_gui, math.
- Simulated the spread of infection using where each person is represented by a circle.
- The circles can be differentiated by colors; BLUE = Susceptible, Red = Infected and Green = Recovered.
- Different properties for the spread of infections; NUM_AGENTS = how many people/agents to simulate | RADIUS: size of the circle drawn for each agent | SPEED: how fast they move | INFECTION_RADIUS: how close one must be to another to transmit infection | INFECTION_TIME: how long they stay infected before recovering
- All the properties for the spread of infections can be controlled using the slider panel on the right.
- Every individual starts as susceptible.
